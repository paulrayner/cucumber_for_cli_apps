== Our Goal

Create a simple Ruby command line utility for changing the extension for a set
of files in a specified folder

== Pair Exercise

Come up with a realistic example of how our rename program should work

[role="vertical"]
== Specification by Example

=== Why Examples?

[role="incremental"]
* Focus on understanding the business domain
* Improve collaboration with non-technical people
* Become tests

=== Scenarios & Tests

[role="vertical"]
== Exploring Scenarios

=== First Example

Replace every file in a folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`

=== Be Concrete

[role="incremental"]
* Folder name: `photos`
* Existing extension: `jpeg`
* New extension: `jpg`

=== No, Even _More_ Concrete!

If the following files are in the `photos` folder:

* `a.jpeg`
* `b.jpeg`
* `c.jpeg`

Then after the `bulkrename` command runs we should see these three files
renamed to:

* `a.jpg`
* `b.jpg`
* `c.jpg`

=== Another Example

Update the extension to `md` for Markdown text files with 
`TXT` and `txt` extensions

[role="vertical"]
== What About the Future?

=== (Possible) Future Scenarios

[role="incremental"]
* Will need to handle more sophisticated file renaming schemes and options
* _Since we will need these capabilities, shouldn't we build them now?_

=== NO! Don't Get Distracted!

Focus for now on the simple case: renaming extensions

[role="incremental"]
* Hard code the command arguments for now. Yes, _hard code_ them!

extension from the arguments (once we are sure the rename is working correctly)

== Next Scenario

=== Examples So Far

[role="incremental"]
. Replace every file in `photos` folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`
. _Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder_ <-

=== Scenario

* Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder
** `txt` to `md`
** `textfiles` folder

=== Add to Feature File

----
  Scenario: Rename files in specified folder with extension to completely new file type
    Given an empty file named "textfiles/doc1.txt"
    And an empty file named "textfiles/doc2.txt"
    And an empty file named "textfiles/doc3.txt"
    When I run `bulkrename textfiles txt md`
    Then the following files should exist:
    | textfiles/doc1.md |
    | textfiles/doc2.md |
    | textfiles/doc3.md |

----

=== Test Fails

Expected...now let's implement!

=== Refactor: Remove hardcoding

[role=incremental]
* Extract `folder,` `find_type` and `replace_type` values from the three arguments to the `bulkrename` command.
* Check whether the file extension is the same as `find_type` for each file in the specified `folder`
* If it is, rename it with the `replace_type` extension.

=== Refactor

----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
$: << File.expand_path("../lib/", __FILE__)

folder = ARGV[0]
find_type = ARGV[1]
replace_type = ARGV[2]

Dir.foreach(folder) do |file_name|
 type = File.extname(file_name).gsub(/^\./, '')
 if type == find_type
   old_name = folder + "/" + file_name
   new_name = folder + "/" + File.basename(file_name, ".#{type}") + "." + replace_type
   File.rename(old_name, new_name)
 end
end
----

[NOTE]
====
Rerun Cucumber
Both the first scenario and the new markdown files scenario now pass
====

[role="vertical"]
== Next Example

=== Examples So Far

[role="incremental"]
. Replace every file in `photos` folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`
. Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder
. _Case-insensitive replacement_ <-

=== Ignoring Case

Replacing `TXT` and `txt` with `csv` in a manner that ignores case

=== Add to Feature file

----
  Scenario: Rename files in specified folder by extension ignoring case
    Given an empty file named "textfiles/May-financials.txt"
    And an empty file named "textfiles/June-financials.TXT"
    And an empty file named "textfiles/July-financials.TXT"
    When I run `bulkrename textfiles txt csv`
    Then the following files should exist:
    | textfiles/May-financials.csv |
    | textfiles/June-financials.csv |
    | textfiles/July-financials.csv |
----

[NOTE]
====
When you run Cucumber now you will see that `June-financials.TXT` causes
this new scenario to fail. Let's refactor our script to ignore the case
of the file extensions:
====

=== Ignore Case of File Extensions

----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
$: << File.expand_path("../lib/", __FILE__)

folder = ARGV[0]
find_type = ARGV[1]
replace_type = ARGV[2]

Dir.foreach(folder) do |file_name|
 type = File.extname(file_name).gsub(/^\./, '')
 if type.downcase == find_type.downcase
   old_name = "#{folder}/" + file_name
   new_name = "#{folder}/" + File.basename(file_name, ".#{type}") + ".#{replace_type}"
   File.rename(old_name, new_name)
 end
end
----

[NOTE]
====
Now the first three scenarios pass, and while we still have other things
to implement, we have the makings of a robust, easy to use bulk rename
script.
====

[role="vertical"]
== Adding New Scenarios and Refactoring

=== Examples So Far

[role="incremental"]
. Replace every file in `photos` folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`
. Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder
. Case-insensitive replacement
. _Handle default command output_ <-

=== Default Command Output

Ensure is helpful when no arguments are specified:

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Default script output is correct
    When I run `bulkrename`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain:
    """
    USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension>
    """
----

[NOTE]
====
Notice that we've tagged it with `@wip` so we can opt to selectively run only
this scenario using the `--tags` command-line option:
====

=== Using Tags

----
cucumber --tags @wip features/bulkrename.feature
----

=== Make it Pass

Add to `bulkrename` before we pull the values out of the arguments:

----
if ARGV.size == 0 then
  puts 'USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension>'
  exit 0
end
----

[role="vertical"]
== New Example

=== Examples So Far

[role="incremental"]
. Replace every file in `photos` folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`
. Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder
. Case-insensitive replacement
. Handle default command output
. _Don't overwrite files_ <-

=== New Scenario

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Do not overwrite existing file(s)
    Given an empty file named "photos/d.jpeg"
    And an empty file named "photos/d.jpg"
    When I run `bulkrename photos jpeg jpg`
    Then the following files should exist:
      | photos/d.jpeg |
      | photos/d.jpg  |
----

[NOTE]
====
It would also be prudent to ensure that our `bulkrename` script is not going
to overwrite a file if it already exists, so let's create a new `@wip`
scenario for that (don’t forget to remove the `@wip` tag from the previous
scenario):
====

=== Update Bulkrename

----
   if not File.exists?(new_name)
     File.rename(old_name, new_name)
   end
----

[NOTE]
====
Running Cucumber again will show that this fails, so let's update the script
to make it pass by wrapping the `File.rename` operation in a conditional:

Now when we run Cucumber the "Do not overwrite existing file(s)"
scenario passes, so we can be confident that our script behaves well in
the event that a file already exists.
====

[role="vertical"]
== Never Overwrite a File?

=== Examples So Far

[role="incremental"]
. Replace every file in `photos` folder that ends with the extension `jpeg` with the
new extension `jpg`
. Handling Markdown files in `textfiles` folder
. Case-insensitive replacement
. Handle default command output
. Don't overwrite files
. _Prompt to overwrite files_ <-

=== Add New Switch

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Detect an existing file
    Given an empty file named "photos/d.jpeg"
    And an empty file named "photos/d.jpg"
    When I run `bulkrename photos jpeg jpg --askoverwrite`
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    File 'photos/d.jpg' already exists, do you want to overwrite it (y/n)?
    """
----

[NOTE]
====
What if we do want to overwrite certain files on occasion? It would be good to
be able to handle gracefully the situation when a file we want to rename
already exists by prompting the user to overwrite the existing file or not.
Let’s do this by adding a switch to `bulkrename` which will cause an existing
file to be overwritten when the user indicates that she wants this to happen,
and doing the default behavour otherwise.
====

=== Check for Overwrites

----
    if File.exists?(new_name) && ARGV[3] == "--askoverwrite"
      print "File '#{new_name}' already exists, do you want to overwrite it (y/n)?"
    end
   if not File.exists?(new_name)
     File.rename(old_name, new_name)
   end
----

[NOTE]
====
Now when we run Cucumber this "Detect an existing file" scenario passes.
Clearly this is not all that we want to do yet. But don't be
disappointed, implementing this incomplete scenario still constitutes
making important progress. We've verified several significant
intermediate things that get us much closer to our goal: that we can
parse the new switch, detect the existing file, and display the
appropriate message.
====

=== Interactive Aruba

----
  Scenario: Choose to overwrite an existing file
    Given an empty file named "photos/d.jpeg"
      And an empty file named "photos/d.jpg"
      When I run `bulkrename photos jpeg jpg --askoverwrite` interactively
      And I type "yes"
      Then the following files should exist:
        | photos/d.jpg |
      And the output should contain:
      """
      File 'photos/d.jpg' already exists, do you want to overwrite it (y/n)?
      """
      And the output should contain:
      """
      Overwriting file 'photos/d.jpg'
      """
----

[NOTE]
====
We've renamed the scenario to "Choose to overwrite an existing file,"
added a new step that checks that the file has in fact been overwritten
(i.e. only photos/d.jpg should exist), and another new step that checks
for a helpful message to be displayed in the output indicating that the
existing file has been overwritten. Notice that since we need to ask the
user something, we have specified _interactively_ for Aruba in the step
that runs `bulkrename.` We have also added another Aruba-based step to
enter in the correct response to the question the script will ask. Now
we have the complete scenario that we hoped for all along, but were
unsure exactly what it needed to be when we started it.
====

=== Incomplete!?!?

[role="incremental"]
* _Don't worry if the only step you can think to write and implement feels
incomplete_
* You can always refactor it or extend it once you get it working.

[NOTE]
====
Making each new scenario zoom in on a clear, specific goal equips you to move
forward gradually and methodically, but with confidence.
====

=== Goal-Driven Approach

[role="incremental"]
* *Narrows the implementation focus* for each scenario to accomplishing one
distinct, well-defined goal. 
* *Helps us deal with uncertainty*, where perhaps we can't see a clear way forward, but can at least see the next step.

=== Goal-Driven Approach

* Constraining and then subsequently refactoring scenarios in this way:
[role="incremental"]
** Gives us the *courage to proceed when the final solution seems vague* and perhaps even in
doubt
** *Minimizes the time spent with broken tests*
** Helps us to *go faster overall*
** Guides us towards a *right solution*

[role="vertical"]
== Make it Pass

=== And Refactor...

[role="incremental"]
* Extract out some new well-named methods and variables
* Use File.Join to build the file names instead of conventional string operations

=== Final Code

----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
$: << File.expand_path("../lib/", __FILE__)

def do_overwrite(ask_overwrite, new_name)
  overwrite = false
  if ask_overwrite
    print "File '#{new_name}' already exists, do you want to overwrite it (y/n)?"
    input = STDIN.gets.strip
    overwrite = true if input[0].downcase == 'y'
  end

  puts "Overwriting file '#{new_name}'" if overwrite == true
  overwrite
end

def do_rename(ask_overwrite, new_name)
  return true if not File.exists?(new_name)
  return true if File.exists?(new_name) && do_overwrite(ask_overwrite, new_name)
end

if ARGV.size == 0
  puts 'USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension>'
  exit 0
end
----

=== Continued...

folder = ARGV[0]
find_type = ARGV[1]
replace_type = ARGV[2]

if ARGV[3]
  ask_overwrite = ARGV[3] == "--askoverwrite"

    new_name = File.join(folder, File.basename(file_name, ".#{type}") + ".#{replace_type}")
    if do_rename(ask_overwrite, new_name)
      File.rename(old_name, new_name)
    end
  end
end
----

=== When Not Overwriting...

----
  Scenario: Choose not to overwrite an existing file
    Given an empty file named "photos/d.jpeg"
    And an empty file named "photos/d.jpg"
    When I run `bulkrename photos jpeg jpg --askoverwrite` interactively
    And I type "no"
    Then the following files should exist:
      | photos/d.jpeg |
      | photos/d.jpg  |
    And the output should contain:
    """
    File 'photos/d.jpg' already exists, do you want to overwrite it (y/n)?
    """
    But the output should not contain:
    """
    Overwriting file 'photos/d.jpg'
    """
----

== Done! (for now)

[role="incremental"]
* Nicely factored, easy-to-understand script
* Feature file that covers all the behavior we currently care about

[role="vertical"]
== Adding Your Own Steps

=== Why Your Own?

Treat the steps included by Aruba as _examples_ rather than templates.

[NOTE]
=====
There are some improvements we can make to our feature file. Remember, we want
to be refactoring our feature file, incorporating our learning and ubiquitous
language. As we’ve already mentioned, we should endeavor to write scenarios
centered around the goals that we want to accomplish and the immediate tasks
that support those goals. We should avoid writing steps that are too finely-
grained because they concentrate on the actions that are required to
accomplish the tasks. For this reason you should regard

The steps provided out-of-the-box by Aruba will help you get started, but if
you only ever use the Aruba steps provided it is likely that you will end up
writing Cucumber scenarios that look like a series of imperative actions,
instead of capturing in the ubiquitous language what is important in terms of
the user's goals and the tasks required to accomplish these goals. 
=====

=== Improve the Language

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Default script output is correct
    When I run `bulkrename`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain:
    """
    USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension>
    """
----

Can this be improved?

=== Improve the Language

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Default script output is correct
    When I run `bulkrename`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain:
    """
    USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension>
    """
----

Check for the correct _usage message_, rather than just looking for
certain text:

----
  @wip
  Scenario: Default script output is correct
    When I run `bulkrename`
    Then the correct usage message should be displayed:
    """
    USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension> [--askoverwrite]
    """
----

[NOTE]
====
This updated scenario includes the new switch, but also now describes
more clearly the task that is important to accomplish the goal.
====

=== Our Own Aruba Step Definiton

----
Then /^the correct usage message should be displayed:$/ do |usage_message|
  assert_partial_output(usage_message, all_output)
  last_exit_status.should == 0
end
----

Create `bulkrename_steps.rb` in `feature/step_definitions`

[role="vertical"]
== What About Collaborating?

=== Consulting with QA

After discussing the script with the tester on our team, we identified other
error scenarios which should also be handled in the same basic manner...

=== New Scenarios

[role="incremental"]
* `<find extension>` is missing (eg. `bulkrename photos`)
* `<replace extension>` is missing (eg. `bulkrename photos txt`)
* Optional argument/switch has incorrect format (eg.
`bulkrename photos txt option`)
* Optional argument has correct format but is invalid (eg.
`bulkrename photos txt —verbose`)

=== See a Pattern?

[role="incremental"]
* Many, many scenarios where only the arguments and error message change
* In each case, the arguments and error message are changing together
* Can't we write scenarios to avoid repetitious scenarios?

=== Scenario Outline

----
  @wip
  Scenario Outline: Parameters should be present and valid
    Given an empty file named "photos/doc1.txt"
    When I run `bulkrename <arguments>`
    Then the program should exit by displaying the error:
    """
    Error: <message>
    """

  Examples:
    | arguments                            | message                           |  
    | photos jpeg jpg --askoverwrite extra | Too many arguments                |  
    | documents txt md                     | Folder 'documents' does not exist |
----

=== Adding More Examples is Easy Now

[NOTE]
====
Though we would typically do
each of these one at a time, specifying and then implementing, the
complete scenario would look as follows
====

----
  @wip
  Scenario Outline: Parameters should be present and valid

  Examples:
    | arguments                            | message                           |  
    | photos jpeg jpg --askoverwrite extra | Too many arguments                |  
    | documents txt md                     | Folder 'documents' does not exist |  
    | photos                               | <find extension> is required      |  
    | photos txt                           | <replace extension> is required   |  
    | photos txt md extra                  | Invalid option format 'extra'     |  
    | photos jpeg jpg --verbose            | Invalid option name '--verbose'   |

=== Argument Processing Code

----
if ARGV.size == 0
  puts 'USAGE: bulkrename <folder name> <find extension> <replace extension> [--askoverwrite]'
  exit 0
end
abort 'Error: Too many arguments' if ARGV.size > 4
abort("Error: <find extension> is required") if ARGV.size == 1
abort("Error: <replace extension> is required") if ARGV.size == 2

folder = ARGV[0]
find_type = ARGV[1]
replace_type = ARGV[2]

if ARGV[3]
  abort "Error: Invalid option format '#{ARGV[3]}'" unless ARGV[3][0..1] == "--"
  ask_overwrite = ARGV[3] == "--askoverwrite"
  abort "Error: Invalid option name '#{ARGV[3]}'" unless ask_overwrite
end

abort("Error: Folder '#{folder}' does not exist") unless File.exists?(folder)

[NOTE]
====
Future error conditions that need to be handled can simply be added to
this existing scenario outline without any further effort.

Notice that we did not add a scenario outline until it was clear that
it would be helpful. When you find a scenario repeated a couple of times
then refactor it to a scenario outline, but only when it becomes clear
you need to deal with three or more similar cases. Try to avoid the
tendency to assume from the outset that a scenario outline is what will
be needed

== Conclusion

[role="incremental"]
* Crafting our steps in this way allows us to *focus on the important
details* and *abstract away the inconsequential* ones
* *It takes practice* to know how much detail to put in a scenario step
versus what goes into the step definition
* With *collaborative practice* and *refactoring your scenarios* as you learn more about
the business domain a good balance can be achieved.
